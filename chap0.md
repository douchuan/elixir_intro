### Finding a Library

The first port of call is [elixir lang](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/), the Elixir documentation. Often you’ll find a built-in library that does what you want.Next, check if any standard Erlang libraries do what you need. This isn’t a simple task. Visit [erlang](http://erlang.org/doc/) and look in the left sidebar for Application Groups. There you’ll find libraries sorted by top-level category.If you find what you’re looking for in either of these two places, you can stop, because all these libraries are already available to your application. But if they don’t have what you need, you’ll have to add an external dependency.

The next place to look is [hex](http://hex.pm), the Elixir/Erlang Package Manager. This is a (small, but growing) list of packages that integrate nicely with a mix-based project.

If all else fails, Google and GitHub are your friends. Search for terms such as elixir http client or erlang distributed logger, and you’re likely to turn up the libraries you need.
